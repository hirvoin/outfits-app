# Outfits

## Motivation

After reading a [blogpost](https://www.reaktor.com/blog/why-ive-tracked-every-single-piece-of-clothing-ive-worn-for-three-years/) about garment usage tracking (and becoming rather fascinated by the idea), I thought that I could build a mobile application with similiar functionality for my own use. On top of that, I wanted to gain more familiarity with using Expo, GraphQL and Golang.

## Todo

- Firebase integration
  - Proper authentication handling
  - Image uploading
- Basic CI/CD

## Develop

1. Install `expo` and `yarn`
2. Install Android emulator (or Expo Go app to your Android device)
3. Run `yarn` to install project dependencies
4. Run `yarn start` to run Metro server
5. Press `a` to run app in your emulator (or scan QR code with Expo Go/iOS device)
